# Installing GitHub

# $ apt-get install git

# Configuring GitHub

# The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and
# e-mail address. This is important because every Git commit uses this informa-tion,
# and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

# $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
# $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

# Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that
# will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. If not configured, Git uses
# your system’s default editor, which is generally Vim. If you want to use a differ-
# ent text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:

# $ git config --global core.editor emacs

# If you want to check your settings, you can use the git config --list com-
# mand to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

# $ git config --list

# You can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing git config <key> :

# $ git config user.name

# If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual
# page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

# $ git help <verb>
# $ git <verb> --help
# $ man git-<verb>


# For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running
# $ git help config
